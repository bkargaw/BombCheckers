# BombCheckers
  [BombCheckers live]()

## Background
  BombCheckers is inspired by the classic game of checkers but with a twist. The game will be played by two different players playing from the same machine. the twist on the classic game is that there will be three different piece types each player's side.  

### piece types
  1. classic checkers piece
  2. bomb checkers piece
  3. shield checkers piece

  The back row will have the *classic* checker pieces. The second row will contain *bomb* pieces that move and behave like classic checker pieces but will explode when they capture the other players piece; during the aforementioned explosion any piece within one gird space from the explosion except shield pieces on any player's side will die form the explosion. The last pice type will be a *shield* piece which will move  and behave like classic piece but will be impervious to any explosion.
